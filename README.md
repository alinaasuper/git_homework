#Git + GitHub training equipped me with the knowledge and skills needed to effectively use version control, collaborate with a development team, and contribute to open-source projects. It's an essential toolset for modern software development and project management.
Challenges you faced while completing the tasks -> The only "challenge" was to remember the basic commands
I learned about main types of test automation frameworks and some of them were new for me.
